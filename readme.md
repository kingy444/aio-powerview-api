# Aio PowerView API

A python async API for PowerView blinds written for Home-Assistant.

Have a look at the examples folder for some guidance how to use it.

\^ Capability 11 shades have the same functionality as capability 8 shades, plus an inbuild light. Light management not available via aiopvapi at this time

## Shades

Shades that have been directly added to the API are listed below and should function correctly. In **most** cases this is identification is purely aestetic.

Shades not listed will get their features from their **capabilities**, unfortunately the json returned from the shade can sometimes be incorrect and we need to override the features for the API (and Home-Assistant) to read them correctly.
